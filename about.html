  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
    CardiKind began in late 2024, sparked by a simple but powerful realization. While conducting extensive research into various forms of heart disease, our founder, Aiden Chavda, noticed a troubling pattern: despite being the leading cause of death globally, cardiovascular disease received far less attention than it deserved. The science was clear, the impact was undeniable—yet awareness remained strikingly low.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
    What started as a small personal project quickly grew into something more. Aiden saw that by bridging the gap between medical knowledge and public understanding, real change was possible. With that belief, CardiKind was born—not just as a platform to share facts, but as a movement to spark conversations, shift perspectives, and bring heart health to the forefront of public consciousness.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
    Today, CardiKind stands as a nonprofit committed to raising awareness about heart disease through education, outreach, and community-driven initiatives. What began with a single idea has become a growing organization with a bold vision: to change the way the world sees heart disease—and, eventually, to change the world itself.
